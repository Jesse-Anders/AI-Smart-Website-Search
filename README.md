## AI Smart Website Search Tool
_Agentic System - Built with LangChain - Utilizing GPT4o-mini and TAVILY search tool_

This smart search tool searches a defined website and return results with pertinent URLs from the website. It is currently setup to demonstrate on the ConsumersEnergy.com website. (I have no professional affiliation with Consumers Energy. This is just a demo)

### Making Basic Alterations
Changes to the AI agentic sytem and search functionality can all be made in the lang_bot_build.py<br>
The Tavily search tool's current setup allows it to search ConsumersEnergy.com and can be easily changed.
```python
tool = TavilySearchResults(
    max_results=5,
    search_depth="advanced",
    include_answer=True,
    include_raw_content=True,
    include_images=False,
    include_domains=["https://www.consumersenergy.com/"],
    # exclude_domains=[...],
    # name="...",            # overwrite default tool name
    # description="...",     # overwrite default tool description
    # args_schema=...,       # overwrite default args_schema: BaseModel
)
```

The Prompt Agent can also be changed to match the desired company information. Right now the system is acting as a writing assistant for ConsumersEnergy.com.
```python
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate(
    [
        ("system", "You are a helpful writing assistant to improve information for customers of ConsumersEnergy.com. "
                   "You clean up rough drafts and make them friendly and professional for customers to read. "
                   "You NEVER alter URLs from the rough drafts you receive."),
        ("human", "{combined_input}"),  # Combined user and tool input
    ]
)
```

### Understanding the Agent Flow in lang_bot_build.py
This is a simple 2 part Langnchain agentic system. _(llm_chain = prompt | llm_with_tools)_ wherin the Tavily search tool (llm_with_tools) runs a search based on the user inquiry and outputs its search results formatted with URLs. This result/output is then handed off to the 'prompt' which cleans up the content and generates a 'cutomer service styled' final response. In the current setup both the prompt and the llm_with_tools utilize gtp4o-mini, but each can utilize their own models if need be.
